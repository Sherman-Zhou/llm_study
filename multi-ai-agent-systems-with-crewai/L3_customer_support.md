# L3: Multi-agent Customer Support Automation

In this lesson, you will learn about the six key elements which help make Agents perform even better:
- Role Playing
- Focus
- Tools
- Cooperation
- Guardrails
- Memory

The libraries are already installed in the classroom. If you're running this notebook on your own machine, you can install the following:
```Python
!pip install crewai==0.28.8 crewai_tools==0.1.6 langchain_community==0.0.29
```


```python
# Warning control
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')
```

- Import libraries, API and LLM


```python
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew
```


```python
import os
from utils import get_openai_api_key

openai_api_key = get_openai_api_key()
os.environ["OPENAI_MODEL_NAME"] = 'gpt-3.5-turbo'
```

## Role Playing, Focus and Cooperation


```python
support_agent = Agent(
    role="Senior Support Representative",
	goal="Be the most friendly and helpful "
        "support representative in your team",
	backstory=(
		"You work at crewAI (https://crewai.com) and "
        " are now working on providing "
		"support to {customer}, a super important customer "
        " for your company."
		"You need to make sure that you provide the best support!"
		"Make sure to provide full complete answers, "
        " and make no assumptions."
	),
	allow_delegation=False,
	verbose=True
)
```

- By not setting `allow_delegation=False`, `allow_delegation` takes its default value of being `True`.
- This means the agent _can_ delegate its work to another agent which is better suited to do a particular task. 


```python
support_quality_assurance_agent = Agent(
	role="Support Quality Assurance Specialist",
	goal="Get recognition for providing the "
    "best support quality assurance in your team",
	backstory=(
		"You work at crewAI (https://crewai.com) and "
        "are now working with your team "
		"on a request from {customer} ensuring that "
        "the support representative is "
		"providing the best support possible.\n"
		"You need to make sure that the support representative "
        "is providing full"
		"complete answers, and make no assumptions."
	),
	verbose=True
)
```

* **Role Playing**: Both agents have been given a role, goal and backstory.
* **Focus**: Both agents have been prompted to get into the character of the roles they are playing.
* **Cooperation**: Support Quality Assurance Agent can delegate work back to the Support Agent, allowing for these agents to work together.

## Tools, Guardrails and Memory

### Tools

- Import CrewAI tools


```python
from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool, \
                         ScrapeWebsiteTool, \
                         WebsiteSearchTool
```

### Possible Custom Tools
- Load customer data
- Tap into previous conversations
- Load data from a CRM
- Checking existing bug reports
- Checking existing feature requests
- Checking ongoing tickets
- ... and more

- Some ways of using CrewAI tools.

```Python
search_tool = SerperDevTool()
scrape_tool = ScrapeWebsiteTool()
```

- Instantiate a document scraper tool.
- The tool will scrape a page (only 1 URL) of the CrewAI documentation.


```python
docs_scrape_tool = ScrapeWebsiteTool(
    website_url="https://docs.crewai.com/how-to/Creating-a-Crew-and-kick-it-off/"
)
```

##### Different Ways to Give Agents Tools

- Agent Level: The Agent can use the Tool(s) on any Task it performs.
- Task Level: The Agent will only use the Tool(s) when performing that specific Task.

**Note**: Task Tools override the Agent Tools.

### Creating Tasks
- You are passing the Tool on the Task Level.


```python
inquiry_resolution = Task(
    description=(
        "{customer} just reached out with a super important ask:\n"
	    "{inquiry}\n\n"
        "{person} from {customer} is the one that reached out. "
		"Make sure to use everything you know "
        "to provide the best support possible."
		"You must strive to provide a complete "
        "and accurate response to the customer's inquiry."
    ),
    expected_output=(
	    "A detailed, informative response to the "
        "customer's inquiry that addresses "
        "all aspects of their question.\n"
        "The response should include references "
        "to everything you used to find the answer, "
        "including external data or solutions. "
        "Ensure the answer is complete, "
		"leaving no questions unanswered, and maintain a helpful and friendly "
		"tone throughout."
    ),
	tools=[docs_scrape_tool],
    agent=support_agent,
)
```

- `quality_assurance_review` is not using any Tool(s)
- Here the QA Agent will only review the work of the Support Agent


```python
quality_assurance_review = Task(
    description=(
        "Review the response drafted by the Senior Support Representative for {customer}'s inquiry. "
        "Ensure that the answer is comprehensive, accurate, and adheres to the "
		"high-quality standards expected for customer support.\n"
        "Verify that all parts of the customer's inquiry "
        "have been addressed "
		"thoroughly, with a helpful and friendly tone.\n"
        "Check for references and sources used to "
        " find the information, "
		"ensuring the response is well-supported and "
        "leaves no questions unanswered."
    ),
    expected_output=(
        "A final, detailed, and informative response "
        "ready to be sent to the customer.\n"
        "This response should fully address the "
        "customer's inquiry, incorporating all "
		"relevant feedback and improvements.\n"
		"Don't be too formal, we are a chill and cool company "
	    "but maintain a professional and friendly tone throughout."
    ),
    agent=support_quality_assurance_agent,
)

```

### Creating the Crew

#### Memory
- Setting `memory=True` when putting the crew together enables Memory.


```python
crew = Crew(
  agents=[support_agent, support_quality_assurance_agent],
  tasks=[inquiry_resolution, quality_assurance_review],
  verbose=2,
  memory=True
)
```

### Running the Crew

**Note**: LLMs can provide different outputs for they same input, so what you get might be different than what you see in the video.

#### Guardrails
- By running the execution below, you can see that the agents and the responses are within the scope of what we expect from them.


```python
inputs = {
    "customer": "DeepLearningAI",
    "person": "Andrew Ng",
    "inquiry": "I need help with setting up a Crew "
               "and kicking it off, specifically "
               "how can I add memory to my crew? "
               "Can you provide guidance?"
}
result = crew.kickoff(inputs=inputs)

    Thank you for reaching out with your question on how to add memory to your crew in CrewAI. I understand the importance of setting up a Crew and kicking it off successfully for your work at DeepLearningAI.
    
    To enhance the memory and performance of your crew in CrewAI, the combination of Crews and Flows plays a significant role. Crews are groups of agents working together on specific tasks or projects within the CrewAI platform. By organizing agents based on skills and expertise, Crews promote collaboration, communication, and efficiency. This ensures that the right agents are assigned to the right tasks, leading to improved productivity.
    
    Flows, on the other hand, are structured sequences of steps that agents follow to complete tasks. These steps include data collection, analysis, decision-making, and execution. By defining clear Flows, workflow is streamlined, errors are reduced, and consistency in output is maintained.
    
    When Crews and Flows are effectively combined in CrewAI, several benefits arise. Firstly, the structured framework enhances the team's memory by providing easy access to task-related information, ensuring knowledge is retained and shared among team members. Secondly, the performance of the crew is optimized through workflow efficiency, minimal bottlenecks, and improved task allocation. Clear roles and responsibilities enable agents to focus on core tasks, increasing productivity.
