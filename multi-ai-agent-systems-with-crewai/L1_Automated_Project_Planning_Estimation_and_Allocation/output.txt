8. **Optimize for Loading Speed & SEO:** This accountability stays with Jane Doe to ensure that optimizations align with the existing code framework, directly influencing the performance outcomes.

9. **Integrate Social Media Links:** This task is assigned to Jane Doe, utilizing her familiarity with the overall platform to ensure seamless integration of third-party API functionalities.

10. **Implement Testimonials Section:** Similar to the previous task, Jane Doe is uniquely positioned to handle this due to her comprehensive knowledge of the project architecture.

11. **Quality Assurance Testing:** Alice Johnson and Tom Brown, with their QA Engineer roles, are equally suited to conduct thorough testing over two weeks to identify and resolve issues across multiple website facets.

12. **Launch the Website:** This final phase requires coordination, led by John Doe to manage the launch process with Jane Doe handling technical monitoring and any immediate troubleshooting related to the launch.
